"""Regenerate the repository README.md from on-disk SKILL.md frontmatter.

Run after adding, moving, or editing skills so the README inventory never
drifts from the tree:

    python3 scripts/gen_readme.py

What it does:
  * scans every `*/**/SKILL.md` (excluding `outdated-skills/`) and takes each
    skill's `description:` from its YAML frontmatter — the SKILL.md is the
    single source of truth; to change an inventory row, edit the skill,
  * rebuilds the layout table, categories overview, and skills inventory,
  * lists `outdated-skills/` contents in the "Superseded skills" section,
    pointing at the supersession map in `outdated-skills/README.md`.

Directory blurbs are curated in BLURBS below — add an entry when a new
top-level category directory appears (unknown directories fall back to a
generic blurb).

Requires: pyyaml.
