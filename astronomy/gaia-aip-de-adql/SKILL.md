# gaia.aip.de ADQL

## When to Use
Use this skill when users need natural-language-to-ADQL help, TAP query generation, or gaia.aip.de workflow support.

## Procedure
1. Identify the target table and required columns.
2. Translate the scientific intent into explicit ADQL.
3. Capture the exact query text for provenance.
4. Explain assumptions, filters, joins, and limits.

## Canonical Routing

This is a specialized or legacy example skill. For new work, start with `astro-data-access-umbrella` and route through:

- `gaia-aip-data-access`
- `tap-pyvo-adql-access`

Keep this skill for dataset-specific examples, but prefer the canonical skills for new implementations, live probes, REANA execution, and plotting/cache conventions.

## Pitfalls
- Avoid ambiguous joins.
- Always state row limits and filtering conditions.
- Watch for unit and epoch assumptions.

## Verification
- Final ADQL query is shown explicitly.
- The target table/service is named.
- Query assumptions are documented.
