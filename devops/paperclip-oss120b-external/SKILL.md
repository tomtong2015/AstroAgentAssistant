## When to Use
Step‑by‑step guide for turning a fresh Paperclip installation into a publicly reachable service that forwards LLM calls to a custom OSS‑120B model served via an OpenAI‑compatible endpoint. Handles deployment mode, bind settings, authentication exposure, board claim, and environment variables.

## Overview
This skill contains a reusable operational workflow. Follow the existing task-specific steps and examples in the sections below.

## Pitfalls
- Do not hardcode credentials, tokens, or personal secrets.
- Verify external service URLs, paths, and permissions before making changes.
- Keep generated outputs reproducible and record input assumptions.

## Verification
- Confirm required inputs and credentials are available.
- Run the smallest safe command or example before scaling up.
- Check produced files, API responses, or plots before reporting success.

steps:
  - "**1. Adjust server configuration**\\nEdit `~/.paperclip/instances/default/config.json` (or the config you used with `paperclipai onboard`). Replace or add the following keys under `server` and `auth`:\\n```json\\n{\n  \"deploymentMode\": \"authenticated\",\n  \"exposure\": \"public\",\n  \"bind\": \"custom\",\n  \"host\": \"0.0.0.0\",\n  \"customBindHost\": \"0.0.0.0\",\n  \"port\": 3100\n}\n```\\nThen under `auth` set:\\n```json\\n{\n  \"baseUrlMode\": \"explicit\",\n  \"publicBaseUrl\": \"http://<PUBLIC_IP>:3100\"\n}\n```\\n(Replace `<PUBLIC_IP>` with your public IP, e.g., `141.33.165.84`)."
  - "**2. Add LLM block**\\nInside the same config file add an `llm` object (anywhere at top level):\\n```json\\n{\n  \"llm\": {\n    \"provider\": \"openai\",\n    \"apiKey\": \"\",\n    \"model\": \"oss-120b\"\n  }\n}\n```\\nThe empty `apiKey` works because the external endpoint does not require authentication."
  - "**3. Export environment variables**\\n```bash\\nexport OPENAI_API_BASE=\"http://<PUBLIC_IP>:8000/v1\"\\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"\"   # empty password\\nexport OPENAI_MODEL=\"oss-120b\"\\n```\\nAdd these lines to `~/.bashrc` (or your preferred shell rc) so they survive restarts."
  - "**4. Run Paperclip**\\n```bash\\nnpx paperclipai run\\n```\\nThe server will start on `0.0.0.0:3100` (or the next free port if 3100 is already in use, e.g., `3101`). The printed *board‑claim* URL will use the port you see in the startup logs, so keep an eye on the log line `Server listening on 0.0.0.0:<PORT>` and adjust your `publicBaseUrl` if you change the port."
  - "**5. Claim the board (if needed)**

   The simplest way to generate a one‑time admin bootstrap URL is now:
   ```bash
   npx paperclipai auth bootstrap-ceo --force
   ```
   This prints an `Invite URL` you can open in a browser to set (or reset) the admin password, even if an admin user already exists. The `--force` flag forces regeneration of a fresh invite.

   *(Optional quick‑reset via CLI – works if CSRF protection is not enabled)*
   ```bash
   INVITE=$(npx paperclipai auth bootstrap-ceo --force | grep -oP 'http://[^ ]+')
   TOKEN=$(basename "$INVITE")
   curl -X POST "http://141.33.55.137:3101/invite/$TOKEN" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"email":"admin@paperclip.ai","password":"<NEW_PASS>"}'
   ```
   Replace `<NEW_PASS>` with the desired password.

   The original guide’s “board‑claim” wording is still valid – the URL points to
   `/invite/...` which internally maps to the same claim flow.

   Also, when the desired port is already in use, Paperclip will fall back to the next free port (e.g., 3102). Adjust `publicBaseUrl` accordingly.\\nOpen the URL printed in the console (it will look like `http://localhost:3100/board-claim/<token>?code=<code>`). Replace `localhost` with your public IP (`http://<PUBLIC_IP>:3100/...`).\\nCreate the first admin user — this converts the instance from `local_trusted` to a fully authenticated deployment.\\n\n**NOTE:** If the instance already has an admin user (as indicated by the log line “Instance already has an admin user”), you can skip this step and proceed directly to logging in.

   This prints an `Invite URL` you can open in a browser to set the admin password.
   (Older versions used `paperclipai onboard` which no longer accepts `--force`.)
   
   *Note:* If the instance already has an admin user, you can still run the above command to reset the password.

  - "**6. Log in**\\nAfter claiming, go to `http://<PUBLIC_IP>:3100/login` (or click the sign‑in button in the UI) and use the credentials you just set."
  - "**7. Verify LLM routing**\\n```bash\\ncurl -X POST http://<PUBLIC_IP>:3100/v1/chat/completions \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\
     -d '{\"model\":\"oss-120b\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Say hello\"}],\"max_tokens\":10}'\n```\\nThe response should contain a short completion generated by the OSS‑120B model."
pitfalls: |
  - **Deployment mode**: `local_trusted` forces `bind: "loopback"`. Switch to `authenticated` before using a custom bind.
  - **Public exposure**: When `exposure` is `public`, Paperclip expects `auth.baseUrlMode` to be `explicit` and a valid `publicBaseUrl`. Forgetting this causes a doctor warning and may block external access.
  - **HTTPS**: The built‑in doctor warns that public deployments should use HTTPS. For production, place an Nginx (or similar) reverse proxy with TLS in front of Paperclip.
  - **Board claim**: After changing to `authenticated`, Paperclip will refuse UI access until the one‑time claim URL is visited and an admin user is created.
  - **Empty API key**: Ensure you really have no credential required at the external endpoint; otherwise set the appropriate key in `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
verification: |
  - `npx paperclipai doctor` shows *"Valid config"* with only the HTTPS warning.
  - The UI loads at `http://<PUBLIC_IP>:3100/` and you can sign in.
  - A `curl` request to `/v1/chat/completions` returns a JSON payload with a completion from `oss-120b`.
