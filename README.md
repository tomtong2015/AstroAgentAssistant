# AstroAgent Skills Repository

Custom Hermes Agent skills developed by the AIP AstroAgent team. This repository intentionally keeps only project-specific/AIP-developed skills; stock Hermes skills and third-party vendor skills are excluded.

Total: **114** custom skills across **15** categories, plus **14** superseded skills retained in [`outdated-skills/`](outdated-skills/README.md).
